    There's nothing like a set of physics problems to set your heart all a'fluttering. So here's where you find them. I've arranged them in the sequence that I typically follow in my teaching, so you can download them at your convenience (and as many copies as you need).

    By the way, as fair warning, you may discover some problems require knowledge yet to be learned . . . in other words, there is the occasional question in which you'll want to come back to and solve, since they involve concepts you'll be covering at a later date. I know; it would be so much easier if I just gave you problems in a nice linear system, but that's not the messy way physics works.

    So . . . give it your best shot and do some physics<i>!</i>
