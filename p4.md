So every once in a while, you're going to run into something you don't quite "get". And that's when a little outside help might be necessary. Of course, outside help could include . . . oh . . . meeting with your instructor?! Or perhaps looking for some conceptual assistance on-line.
<br />
Therefore, in the spirit of collaboration, here are some links to useful (and hopefully, interesting) sites about physics.

        Just as identified by its name, this site has lots of wonderful -- and extremely short -- minute long videos illustrating everything from What is Gravity? to What is Dark Matter? to Is it Better to Walk or Run in the Rain? Well worth the time!

        This site is an award-winning "romp" (and I'm using that term very loosely) through the world of particle physics. Constructed and maintained by the pros at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
